
                          Whatsnew 1.04

* Added an OS/2 version of LLIST ; this is named LLISTP.EXE ; note 
that this is a preliminary release,  use at  your own  risk ;  the 
LLISTP.EXE can be unpacked using password "ole", that is with  the 
command "Pkunzip -sole LL104b2 llistp.exe";

* Raid command %RESCAN  now sends  only new  files (age  less than 
NewDays); new metacommand %DAYS  can let  your uplink  change this 
value when adding areas with rescan option active;

*   Added  commands  %ANNOUNCE  and  %-ANNOUNCE  to internal  raid 
processor; these will allow  each node  to receive  a netmail  msg 
with announce of new files in linked tic areas;

* Added  commands %TINYSEENBY  and %-TINYSEENBY  to internal  raid 
processor; these will allow each node to strip seen-by lines  from 
received .Tic, limiting them to sender and receiver node;

* Added support for multiple inbound dirs (note: using LORA,  prot 
known and unknown inbound dirs will be scanned for .Tic files);

*   Improved  support for  kludge ^AFDN;  if you  select Fdn  in a 
AnnounceMsg,  L-List  will scan  file areas  which belong  to file 
group with the same tag as Fdn; this can help  you to  make easily 
separate AnnounceMsg for each Fdn;

* Added support for multiple outbound  dirs; they  can be  defined 
both in LList.Cfg and in Tic.Cfg, as:
ZONE <Zone> <Dir>
Normally L-List uses outbound  dir defined  with OUTBOUND  (or the 
first zone found in Tic.Cfg), with the number of the  zone in  the 
extension if it is  different from  the main  address; but  if the 
zone of the node is defined in a ZONE statement,  L-List will  use 
that outbound dir (note: you will need zone statements only if you 
are using binkley with domains);

* Detection of files in index (Lfiles.Idx), does not consider area 
number; that is, a file already present in  another area  will not 
be  announced;  this will  prevent possible  errors occuring  when 
areas are renumbered but index is not updated;

* New desc lines will be appended at the beginning of files.bbs if 
FixFBbsSort is set to SortDate;

* An optional number (0..100) can now be  specified after  keyword 
RepackOptimize; L-List will check  that the  size of  the repacked 
file is less than the old size of this parameter (example, if  you 
set "RepackOptimize 10" and old size is 30k,  L-List will  fail if 
size of the recompressed file is 29k or 28k, and  will accept  the 
new format only if its size is 27k or less, with a gain or  10% or 
more);

*   Added  keyword "NoFirstLine",  that will  force L-List  to not 
preserve  first  line  of  old description  when a  File_Id.Diz is 
imported;

* Utility Scan_Cd.Exe is no longer included in the package; L-List 
bcan now run without SysFile.Dat and SysFile.Idx, reading a 
standard Tic.Cfg;

* Added support for Tic groups; a group  is defined  in LLTic.Cfg, 
as (example):

TicGroup SDN
  Address 2:332/901
  Level 1
  GroupId 1-
  Node 2:332/903
  Node 2:332/904
End

if a new area is created whose tag begins with  GroupId, its  path 
will  be  created  in  <PathNewAreas><GroupTag><AreaTag>,  several 
parameters will be read from the group, and  nodes defined  in the 
group will be automatically linked (note that old flag AutoLink is 
no longer supported); linking to file groups can be managed  using 
L-List internal RAID processor (commands %AUTOLINK <Group> and  %- 
AUTOLINK  <group>;  a list  of available  file groups  can be  got 
sending cammands %AUTOLINK or %-AUTOLINK with no group specified); 
a "!" as 1st char in the group means that area belongs to no group 
(note: TicGroups are not automatically created);

* Fixed a bug with update file (command <Alt-E>);

* Now L-List adds magic names to file desc in announces;

*  Added support for  tic area  descriptions, read  by a  standard 
Raid.Cfg if  this  is  found  in  L-List  dir  (note:  create your 
Raid.Cfg merging FileBone.Na, FileBone.No and your local areas);

* Tic.Cfg now MUST be copied in L-List dir (keyword  TicCfg is  no 
longer supported);

* Stripped TinySeenBy keyword;

* Added  support for  secondary tic  Areas; their  tag is  defined 
after the tag of a standard tic area and is the tag  of a  primary 
file area too; for example:

Area D:\AREA1\ PRIMARY SECONDARY
    2:332/999 PW1
    2:332/998 PW2

Area D:\AREA2\ SECONDARY
    2:332/997 PW3
    2:332/999 PW1

when a file is hatched in Area PRIMARY, it will be echoed to nodes 
998 and 999, and then the file will be hatched  in area  SECONDARY 
and sent  to 997  (999 will  not receive  it again  as it  will be 
already in Seenby); if  a file  is hatched  in area  SECONDARY, it 
will be sent normally to 997 and to 999;

* Added  support for  kludges ^AREPLYTO  and ^AREPLYADDR,  used to 
send a netmail msg via internet gate;

* File names can now be  directly edited;  this will  result in  a 
file rename;

* Fixed bug with TIC processor managing "Magic" lines;

*  Added support for several more keywords in  .Tic (Date,  Size), 
and for keywords with a ":" at the end (that is, "Area:", "File:", 
etc);  L-List  now  ignores  additional  info  in known  tic lines 
without failing, according to Fsc-0028.Txt (unknown lines continue 
to be reported "as  is"); however  L-List always  saves .Tic  in a 
mostly compatible way; 

* L-List now checks size of a file if a line "Size{:}" is found in 
the  .Tic  file;  this  check  can  be  overridden  using  keyword 
"FixSizeTic" in LList.Cfg;

* L-List  now uses  ^APID: line  in msg  instead of  tear line  to 
report info about product type;


                          Wahtsnew 1.03

*  L-List  now uses  environment variable  TEMP for  its temporary 
directory (a dir %TEMP%LLTEMP.<n>,  where <n>  should be  a unique 
name for that task); this is used to uncompress files, using a ram 
disk should speed up L-List;

* Added  two keywords,  BADFILES and  INFECTEDFILES, that  are the 
download  directories  of two  reserved file  areas (visible  from 
files.bbs editor); L-List moves files that  can't be  uncompressed 
in BADFILES,  and files  that seem  to be  infected by  viruses in 
INFECTEDFILES; check can be made in Files.Bbs editor  using Alt-Z, 
or can  be made  automatically via  FixFBbs option  using ",Check" 
(that is, "LList FixFBbs,Check"); note that  now, if  you performe 
multiple   opreations   at   one   time   (for   example,   "LList 
FixFBbs,Check,Repack,ReadFile_Id"), L-List optimizes execution  of 
external shells (file will be uncompressed only once);

* L-List recompress option (Alt-R) now compress file  as it  is if 
its compression type is unknown (for example,  files that  are not 
already compressed);

* Repack tic option now works  separately in  each tic  file area, 
using local keyword Repack  (this will  allow you  to repack  only 
files of certain area, for example UPLOAD);

* Fixed a bug with Tag New Files (Alt-N);

* Now function search in Files.Bbs editor (Alt-W)  tag files  that 
match string (the format is the same used by file-finder,  you can 
search for  paths, keywords,  using logic  operators AND,  OR e  ~ 
(NOT)); if no file is found in the current file area, L-List  will 
prompt to go on  searching in  other areas  (this time  files that 
match the selected keywords will be shown on  the screen,  and you 
will be prompted to immediately switch to that area tagging  found 
files);

* Added support for negative search strings (written  as a  normal 
string but preceeded by a "~"); for example,
llist search:~*.RAR_AND_~*.ZIP
will find files whose  extension is  different from  ZIP and  from 
RAR;

* New  option Alt-B  in Files.Bbs  editor; this  will scan  L-List 
internal database (LList.Db, built by file-finder in search  areas 
flagged with "BuildDb" getting info from announced files) and will 
get a description for current file;

* Fixed a bug with negative values of INDENT that were ignored;

* Packer Pack and Unpack commands now accept two parameters; %1 is 
the  name  of  the  compressed  file,  %2  is  the  name   of  the 
uncompressed file; if you do not specify these  parameters, L-List 
will add them at the end of the command line (for example, a "Pack 
PkZip" will become "Pack PkZip %1  %2"); the  name of  the current 
file in external shells can be omitted, in  this case  L-List will 
add it at the end of the command line (that is, "AltF1 Shez %1" is 
the same as "AltF1 Shez");

* Stripped support for index file in maximus format;

*  Hatch  option now  asks for  the name  of the  file to  replace 
(default, the same name  of the  current file)  and for  the magic 
name to use;

* Added  option to  pack .TIC  (keyword Packer  in TicNodes  cfg); 
using this keyword, L-List  will pack  all .Tic  directed to  that 
node in a only file, whose extension will be the  first letter  of 
the packer followed by "IC" (for example, using ARJ the compressed 
file will have extension  AIC); in  addition, L-List  unpacks file 
with extension *.?IC different from *.TIC, looking for  compressed 
Tic files;

* TIC Cfg file now is named LLTic.Cfg; this file  is automatically 
included, and should contain  both TicAreas  (as contained  in old 
file "TicAreas", but without info about echo nodes,  that will  be 
read from a standard  Tic.Cfg defined  with "TicCfg"  keyword) and 
TicNodes;

* L-List TIC processor now updates  Magic names  according to  Tic 
line "Magic"; a file "Magic.Cfg" in L-List directory will be  used 
(this  will  contain  all  magic  names,  while  old  magic  names 
preceeded by keyword "Magic" in LList.Cfg  will not  be used);  in 
Magic.Cfg, you must not use keyword "Magic", as each line  that is 
not empty will be considered as a magic;

* L-List now uses flag files (*.Bsy) in its directory in order  to 
safely access to files; take care to delete *.Bsy if L-List hungs- 
up;

* L-List does no longer import areas directly  into SysFile.Dat  / 
SysFile.Idx if any area  is added  by Tic  processor; however,  it 
updates data in Tic.Cfg, so that you can easily import new areas;

*  Default  AreaIdAns for  Search is  NetAreaId (that  is, if  you 
don't specify any area where to post results  for remote  searchs, 
L-List will send them via NetMail); in addition,  NetMail area  is 
automatically scanned (you won't' need to define it in *.Cfg);

* L-List does no longer add a line with path to FileIdx in OkFile; 
you must use a line "OkLine" to add it (look at LList.Cfg);

*   You  can select  an alternative  summary report,  with keyword 
"LongSummary";

*  You can define keyword "Comment" in packer cfg; if present,  L- 
List will add a comment to  current file  using this  command when 
repacking it;

*  L-List  now creates  always BDL  (default, 10  files); you  can 
disable it using command line option "BDL 0";

*   Local  Msg  from  <SysopName>  to  RAID are  always processed, 
allowing  sysop  to  make  maintenance  by  Msg;  if   you  define 
<LocalRaidPwd> in LList.Cfg, the subject of the msg  will have  to 
match this keyword (note that this security is not necessary);

* Download counter and flag for free download ("/t", "/b",  "/tb") 
can now be directly edited; old command Alt-1, Alt-2 and Alt-F are 
no longer supported;

* Added keyord "RepackOptimize"; this will make L-List  choice the 
file shorter between the old and the recompressed one; using  this 
option,  you  can optimize  the size  of your  file base,  running 
"LList FixFBbs,Repack" using the most efficient archiver available 
at the moment... each time a  new archiver  is available,  you can 
repack again your filebase, converting to the new format only  the 
files that reduce their size;

* Packer name in FixFBbs option  can now  be specified  in command 
line; that is, "LList FixFbbs,Repack:RAR";

* Some  packer cfg  are pre-defined  (no need  to rewrite  them in 
LList.Cfg): ZIP, ARJ, LZH, RAR, UC2;


                          Whatsnew 1.02

* Option TIC now  runs Raid  even if  no .Tic  file is  found, and 
announces are then made only if any .Tic  file has  been correctly 
processed;

* Fixed bug with address put in path line;

*  New ticnodes keyword, NOTIFY, that will send  a report  to each 
ticnode marked with this  keyword "notify"  with info  about files 
sent/received  via  TIC (automatically  sent each  month, or  even 
before using command line option NOTIFY);

* New command line options, ExportTicCfg  and ImportTicCfg;  LLIST 
will  Write/Read  text  file  defined  with   keyword  TicCfg   in 
LList.Cfg, and will Export/Import TIC info in standard tic format;

* Support for SendOnly/ReceiveOnly nodes; in  ticareas definition, 
a node is by default considered as SendOnly; a node from which  we 
can receive files too, will be followed by a "*"; for example,

Node 2:332/901 *

if a "&" is added (ex: Node 2:332/901  *&), we  can receive  files 
from that node, but we will not send files to him;
Raid will add areas as SendOnly, or with  flags defined  in "Flag" 
keyword in  tic area  definitions (for  example, pre-areas  should 
have "*&" flags, so that downlink  nodes will  be anabled  to send 
files to  your system  but will  not receive  files sent  by other 
nodes; uplink node line will have no flag, so he will be  the only 
node who  will receive  files sent  by your  downlinks); when  new 
areas are  created, creating  node will  be added  as ReceiveOnly, 
autolink nodes as SendOnly;
!!! WARNING !!! Keep care to give your uplink for  tic file  areas 
flag "*" (better, "*&" if you do not  send him  files), if  not L- 
List will not accept files from that node;

*  LList  now  tries  to  read  Desc.Sdi  if   it  fails   reading 
File_Id.Diz;

* Added command %RESCAN to L-List internal Raid; areas added after 
this meta-command will be  added sending  all files  in area  with 
relative tics to requiring node;

* Fixed a bug with %RESEND;

* L-List now reports exit code of executed external programs;

* New  keyword in  packer cfg;  "KBytes" will  let you  define the 
memory requirements of the packer, so that L-List  will swap  only 
if free memory is not enough;


                          Whatsnew 1.01

* Options Alt-M and Alt-C now move/copy current file if no file is 
tagged (otherwise all tagged files will be moved/copied);

* Default option of L-List is now EditFBbs;  if you  want to  make 
file lists,  you must  explicitly write  FILELIST on  command line 
(Ex: LLIST FileList Area 1-10);

*   Packer  engine  has  been  totally  re-written;  old  keywords 
(ZipCompress, ZipUnCompress, etc) are no longer supported, while a 
new powerful  configuration method  can let  you use  every packer 
(look  at  Packer.Cfg for  more details);  Repack option  has been 
added to Files.Bbs editor (Alt-R); if you defined  a valid  Repack 
keyword  in  LList.Cfg,  compressed  file will  be converted  to a 
Repack type compressed file; you can repack all  archive different 
from Repack, using option "FixFBbs,Repack" in  command line  (this 
could take much time);

* Added function Search in Files.Bbs editor (Alt-W);

* Added support for  EXCLUDE keywords  to Files.Bbs  editor (Alt-O 
does no longer import files which match exclude specifications);

* Added TIC command line option, that will process TIC  files; you 
must define INBOUND, OUTBOUND, NETAREAID (AreaId of Netmail, to be 
used for RAID, see next section for available commands), TICNODEs, 
TICAREAs (these should be defined in a file named "TicAreas"), for 
example:
TicNode 2:332/313
   Pw PASSWORD
   ; Used for line "To" in .TIC
   ;SysopName Sysop
   ; used by RAID
   ;Level 0
   ; allow creation of new file areas if tic tag is unknown
   ;Create
   ; allow sending raid msg for other nodes (command %FROM <other_node>)
   ;RemoteMaint
   ; will be automatically linked to new created areas, if zone number matches
   ;AutoLink
   ; Select flavour (default Hold)
   ;Crash
   ;Normal
   ; Send file only (without .TIC)
   ;NoTic
End
; All TICAREAS must be written in a file named TICAREAS in LList dir
TicArea LORA
   DownLoad D:\LDN\LORA
   ;Level 0
   Address <Address>
   Node 2:332/402
End

* List of available command for internal raid:
%HELP    Info about use of RAID
%LIST    Index of available file areas
%QUERY   Index of linked file areas
%UNLINKED Index of unlinked file areas
%RESEND <FileName> Resend all files that match <FileName>
%FROM <Address> Allow remote maintenance for other node
%[+]ALL  Add all areas
%-ALL    Remove all areas
[+]AREATAG Add area AREATAG
[+]AREATAG* Add areas whose name begins with AREATAG
ç-AREATAG Remove area AREATAG
-AREATAG* Remove areas whose name begins with AREATAG

* Added HATCH option  in Files.Bbs  editor; current  file will  be 
hatched in selected area;

* Added  keyword NoOrphanUpdate  in LList.Cfg,  that will  prevent 
LList from updating imported orphan files (in FixFBbs option);
!!!  WARNING !!!  Index of areas  modified using  files.bbs editor 
or fixfbbs batch maintenance  is always  updated, so  that if  you 
don't change date of new imported files L-List will not be able to 
find them in announce option; 

* LList always adds File_Id.Diz to description of announced files; 
first line and uploader line are preserved;

* Now detection of new files is not based only on date.  A file is 
considered new if its date is  greater of  last date  announce was 
done OR if it is not present in fileidx; !!!!  WARNING !!!!   keep 
care  to  have  the  index  file  updated  (that  is,  run  "LLIST 
FileIdx"); if it is not updated, every file that is not present in 
the index file will be announced.  Adding new announces, the index 
updating  will  be  made  automatically  the  first time  that the 
announce is processed (if the tag of the announce is not found  in 
LLIST.TIM);

* Announces are automatically made after having processed TIC;

* Fixed  bug that  sometimes put  a "/b"  in files  description in 
FixFBbs option;

* Changed orphan management; description is obtained by  importing 
File_Id.Diz  and  repacking it  (so that  you will  no longer  get 
OrphanStr in  the first  line of  description); files  are updated 
unless you insert "NoOrphanUpdate"  in LList.Cfg,  and File_Id.Diz 
can be inserted only if you select "ReadFile_Id"  in command  line 
(this could result in a second  line that  is a  duplicate of  the 
first  line);  the  same  management strategy  is used  inside the 
Files.Bbs editor (getting description and updating);

* New registration site in UK (look at Register.Frm);

* Added 2 areas, "Drive A:" and "Drive B:", to let you easily copy 
files to and from diskettes;

* Fixed offline and orphan detection in RA file-base (FixFBbs  and 
EditFBbs options);

* New macros in Files.Bbs  editor: <Shift-F1>  will let  you enter 
avatar codes for colors, <Shift-F2> ansi codes;

* Fixed a bug in getting macros from menu';

* Added DosShell in Files.Bbs editor [F9];

* Added support for 43 and  50 lines;  be sure  that your  graphic 
adapter support selected mode!  you can switch to this mode inside 
Files.Bbs editor using command line option  L43 or  L50 (you  will 
switch to 43 if you have an EGA or to 50 if you have  a VGA,  this 
parameter does not force rows number); these modes  will never  be 
used under a multitasker; you can force use  of 43/50  lines every 
time, adding keyword "Font8x8" in LList.Cfg; in this case, you can 
swith back to 25 line mode using command line parameter L25;

*  Added  support for  boolean operators  (OR and  AND) in  search 
strings;  OR  is ignored,  while AND  will match  if previous  and 
successive strings are bot found; Example,
LList Search:?332*.*_AND_*313*.*_AND_/List*File

* L-List does no longer search  keywords in  file name;  you muust 
specify a path too if you want to search in the name;

* L-List deletes now previous description of file  when adding  it 
to another area (in TIC option and copy/move  option of  files.bbs 
editor); ***  NOTE ***  L-List never  deletes a  previous existing 
file (it  renames  the  ourrent  file instead),  this option  only 
affects descriptions of missing files;

* Added commad "Tag dupes files" (Alt-G) to Files.Bbs editor;

*  L-List  now automatically  run Scan_Cd.Exe  when new  areas are 
creted by internal TIC processor (cfg keyword SCAN_CD will let you 
define parameters to use), Scan_Cd will run with following command 
line:
SCAN_CD <DirNewAreas> <Scan_Cd>
Scan_Cd will be run  even if  no configuration  file is  found, in 
order to create SysFile.*;
