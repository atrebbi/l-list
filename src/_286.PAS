I've thrown together this little unit here - if your program or unit uses
$G+, just add this as the FIRST! unit in the USES clause. It is called
_286.PAS:
}

(*
  Programs compiled with {$G} compiler directive enabled do not
  check the processor at runtime to determine whether it is
  286-compatible. Trying to execute 80286 instructions on an 8086
  or an 8088 will lock up the computer. This program checks
  for the presence of a 286-compatible chip at runtime.

  Put this unit as the FIRST in the USES clause.

 This can be put in individual units, just make sure it is the FIRST
 unit in the USES clause, eg

  Uses
